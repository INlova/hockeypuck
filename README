Hockeypuck: OpenPGP Key Server
==============================

Full Documentation: https://hockeypuck.github.io

Developer Quickstart:

Assuming that you:
 * Have a recent (1.2 or newer) version of go installed
 * Have $GOPATH/bin in your $PATH

# Check out Hockeypuck sources (without compiling them yet)

 $ go get -d -t github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck

# Hockeypuck uses godeps for third-party package vendoring.
# Install it into your $GOPATH/bin.

 $ go get launchpad.net/godeps
 $ go install launchpad.net/godeps

# Update all third-party packages in $GOPATH to the versions
# that Hockeypuck requires:

 $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck
 $ godeps -u dependencies

# Now you're ready to build, test and install Hockeypuck
 $ go build ./...
 $ go test ./...
 $ go install github.com/hockeypuck/hockeypuck/cmd/hockeypuck

```
